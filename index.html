<p>Implementer of sanity in fast-paced chaos. Pleasant, cheerful and competent in a sea of snark. Currently, I'm at Acquia helping new customers get comfortable and get what they need to get started. I help technologists think about what they're doing, and help explain it to clients in ways that they like hearing. </p>

<p>I've written and presented on project management since 2009. I still like it. </p>
