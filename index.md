Implementer of sanity in fast-paced chaos. Pleasant, cheerful and competent in a sea of snark. Currently, I'm at Acquia helping new customers get comfortable and get what they need to get started. I help technologists think about what they're doing, and help explain it to clients in ways that they like hearing. 

I've written and presented on project management since 2009. I still like it. 
 
## Testimonials:

### Or really just overheard's from people I work with. 
 "Have I ever mentioned that "amyescavarda" sounds like a harry potter spell. It would cause nimrods to suddenly know what the f they're supposed to be doing." 
 "These clients are Hobbits. You are a Ranger and you have just led them through the wilderness."
